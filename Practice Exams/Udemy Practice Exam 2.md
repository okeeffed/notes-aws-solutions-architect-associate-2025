## Attempt 1: 62%

Pretty rough failure for this one. A lot of what I had studied so far didn't turn up on the test, so probably to be expected!

Some of the things I need to brush up on:

- AWS Cognito User Pools vs Identity Pools **(~20 minutes)**
- A lot of EC2 **(~8 hours of content, ~3.5 hours advanced)**
	- Launch configuration vs launch templates
	- What are Spot fleets? Differences to spot instances.
	- Learn what AWS Instance Hibernate is. [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Hibernate.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Hibernate.html)
- VPC (**Basics ~4 hours, Advanced ~2 hours**)
	- Learn about VPC Endpoints [https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/reduce-cost-and-increase-security-with-amazon-vpc-endpoints/](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/reduce-cost-and-increase-security-with-amazon-vpc-endpoints/)
- DataSync + PrivateLink (DataSync **~10 mins**)
	- PrivateLink I might need to learn about elsewhere.
- RDS offerings and differences **(5 hours 40min)**
- AWS Kinesis **(~40 minutes)**
	- Firehose vs Data Streams and how to know the differences.
- Revisit AWS Config - I clearly do not understand it's capabilities.
	- Need to study this more manually.
- AWS EFS, EBS **(part of EC2 sections)**
- AWS IAM. **(~2 hours)**
- Security Groups vs Network Access Control lists. **(part of VPC)**
	- Security groups are stateful, network access control lists are stateless.
- Containers **(~3.5 hours content)**

Based off this, I think the study plan for the work week might look like this:

1. Cover DataSync + Cognito (1 hour) **Sunday**
2. Kinesis (1 hour) **Monday**
3. IAM (2 hours) **Monday**
4. VPC (6 hours) **Tuesday/Wednesday**
5. EC2 (12 hours) **Thursday/Friday/Saturday**
6. Containers (4 hours) **Sunday**
7. RDS (6 hours) **Sunday/Monday**

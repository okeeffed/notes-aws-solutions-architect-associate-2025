## AWS 3-Phase Approach

- The norm, it feels like 25% easy, 50% medium and 25% hard.
- Do the easy questions first, then if possible leave hard until the very end. 
	- Identify the hard questions. Mark them for review.
	- Answer the medium questions.
- With the remaining time, attempt to answer all of the hard questions for the time allocation.
- If it's your first exam, assume you will run out of time.
- Succeed by being efficient.
- 2 mins to read question, answer and make a decision.
- Don't guess until the end. Later questions may remind you of something.
- Suggestion is to follow the Tutorials Dojo tests as they are generally harder.
	- Aim for 90%+ before taking the real exam.

## General technique

- Questions are 1-2 lines of preamble (scenario).
- What follows is the question itself. Identify the **keywords**.
	- 4-5 answers. Generally for 2-3 to be selected.
	- Can be multi-choice or multi-select.
- At associate level, generally answer is simple **right** or **wrong**.
- At other levels, "most suitable" comes up more.
- Generally 1 or 2 answers can be excluded first.
- Most questions have an overall **criteria** or **restriction**. General examples:
	- Cost effective
	- Best practice security (assume for AWS)
	- Highest performance
	- Timeframe
- Try to eliminate any crazy answers.
- Highlight and remove any question fluff.
- Find what matters in the question.
- Identify what matters in the answers.
- Eliminate any bad answers.
- Worst-case, quickly select between what remains.
- **DO NOT PANIC**.

## Raw notes

- More complex systems can use 10s or 100s of AWS Accounts.
- In the Cantrill course, we will use multiple accounts.
- An **AWS Account** is a container for **identities** (users) and **resources**.
- Each account has an account root user with a unique root email address.
- Root users cannot be restricted, but identities can (through Identity and Access Management IAM). 
- By default, all external identities are denied by default. Access needs to be provided.

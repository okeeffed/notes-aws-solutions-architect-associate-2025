Based off this, I'm going to focus on the following Cantrill course sections:

- Hybrid Environments and Migration which covers:
	- Border Gateway Protocol
	- IPSec VPN
	- AWS Site-to-Site VPN
	- Direct Connect (DX)
	- Transite Gatway
	- Storage gateway
	- Snow family
	- FSx
- Security, deployment and operations
	- Secrets Manager
	- Application layer firewall
	- WAF, WebACLs, Rule groups
	- AWS Shield
	- CloudHSM
	- AWS Config
	- AWS Macie
	- AWS Inspector
	- AWS Guard duty
- EC2 basics (partial with focus on EBS)
- Network storage & data lifecycle
	- Focus on EFS

I might also cover the exam section that covers the "3-phase approach".

Finally, if I have time, I was to attempt another practice exam.
